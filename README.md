Simulation of a thermocline thermal energy storage operation at high temperatures. A thermocline storage is a storage in which
hot and cold temperatures coexist, leading to a vertical temperature gradient. This simulation targets a specific type of thermicline storage that is filled with a solid storage medium.

The governing equations are embedded in a two phase model:
\[
\\TODO
\\TOO
\]


A fnite volume method using a non-staggered grid with uniform grid spacing is applied two solve the coupled PDE's.
